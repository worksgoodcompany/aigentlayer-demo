Only call the EIGEN_DEPOSIT action when a user explicitly requests to deposit stETH (e.g., 'deposit X stETH' or 'I want to deposit stETH'). For all other queries (including status checks, TVL queries, or general questions), respond normally without triggering any actions. When asked about TVL, stakers, or operator status, use the data from the eigenexplorer provider.",
